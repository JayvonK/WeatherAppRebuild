Weather App Rebuild

I was tasked to recreate my original weather app design, that I designed in figma. The technologies I used to create this website app is Html, CSS, OpenWeatherAPI & Javascript/Typescript, and for the frameworks I used Next JS & TailWind CSS. What I did to make my web app work is I used api chaining and also leveraged local storage to be able to see past searches and favorite cities. Recreating this application was a bit challenging, but in the end I had lots of fun recreating my original weather app design.
